# Delta Mavericks

 ```
 An application that allows Jasmine to be tracked by RFID through bracelet,
 Facial Recognition, and NFC by tablet while traveling from guardian to guardian.
 The bracelet and tablet will send out checkpoint notifications through SMS or FlyDelta

 with preloaded content for entertainment, headphones, and a small care package created
 by parents online. This technology could be adapted for other Special Request travelers,
 such as ADA, and Senior Citizens.
